# CLI Launchers

These scripts start the lethean binary without knowing how to use the command line.

The window that is shown, is a text based way to interact with the blockchain; it can do everything the GUI can and more. 

It will ask you for information to start or login to your wallet, once you have a wallet loaded, type `help` & hit Enter so see the options.

the only script that uses a remote chain service is "open-wallet-remote.sh"; which uses the node run by https://HashVault.pro

`transfer ADDRESS AMOUNT` --- but type `help` first; maybe im wrong and its Amount then Address, best check `help & ENTER` before sending funds.
